# GeeksBlabla 2021-2023 Financial Report: Impact, Transparency, and Fundraiser

GeeksBlaBla is a non-profit community initiative managed by a collective of volunteers to organize podcasts and events to discuss, highlight, and share the latest IT topics in Moroccan Darija.

GeeksBlaBla receives money from donations and sponsors, and our primary expenses are Tooling & Online Subscriptions, Team setup & support, and T-shirts & Delivery.

Don’t take our word for it - let’s look at some numbers.

## Financial report

### Introduction

The story began before 2021 with the DevC community supported by Facebook. The team used to report all financial information to Facebook, as the community was mainly supported by Facebook through the Developer Circles program.

In 2021, the Facebook Developer Circles program came to an end. The team decided to separate GeeksBlaBla from DevC and become an independent community. The team started to look for sponsors to cover the expenses of the events and the podcast.

We maintain multiple community initiatives, but our main source of income is the BlaBlaConf event, a one-stop shop for the latest and hottest technology trends in Darija, and completely free! and organized yearly.

Here are the two types of sponsoring we have:

- Indirect sponsoring: mainly, the sponsoring company takes care of the expenses, and we do not take any money from them (hosting the event, paying for food, etc.).

- Direct sponsoring: The sponsor agrees to make a transaction of a specific amount in exchange for other benefits (designation as sponsor, booth for events, sessions, etc.).

This report covers only the direct sponsoring part.
